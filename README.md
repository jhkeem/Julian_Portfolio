## About me
Here is someone who loves analyzing everything and love to communicate with people. The reason why my all background leads me to love those. 

I got my Bachelor's Degree from Hongik University in South Korea. My research field was dealing with data for car navigation during school.
And I have worked as a Mobile QA engineer to test UE on LTE and 5G network environment. From my past job, I got two skills which are to find critical bugs and to analyze data much better.

I wish to keep exploiting my skills in QA engineering. Currently, I am intensively taking courses of Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate to perform my future role well as a QA engineer. 

I would be extremely happy to apply obtained knowledge to testing an operational product and gain hands-on experience.
